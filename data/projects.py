        "title": "Autonomous ML Agents: Modular Framework for LLM-Orchestrated Workflows",
        "description": "A production-minded framework where specialized agents plan, execute, critique, and iterate to ship ML work end-to-end. Solves fragmentation across notebooks, scripts, and teams with orchestrated agents featuring shared state, tool use, memory, and governed iteration loops. Features reproducible runs, deterministic scoring/caching, auto-generated reports, and complete audit trails.",

        "title": "Multi-Agent Trading System",
        "description": "A debate-style ensemble of financial agents that propose, critique, and reconcile trade ideas with a backtest engine. Specialized agents (valuation, momentum, sentiment, fundamental) work with a coordinator that fuses signals with transparent rules. Features deterministic scoring, cached datasets with hashes, explainable signal attribution, and audit-ready outputs.",

        "title": "Time-Series Forecasting Agentic Workflow",
        "description": "An autonomous pipeline that cleans data, builds forecasts, evaluates MAPE, and iterates with human-readable plans. The agent generates a plan, executes code, evaluates performance, and refines until thresholds are met. Features auto-reports with plots and decisions, plus guardrails for runtime, retries, and data quality.",

        "title": "Classification Agent (Auto-Train • Evaluate • Explain)",
        "description": "A self-improving classification loop that trains baselines, compares metrics, and explains trade-offs. The agent builds baselines, evaluates accuracy, confusion matrix, precision/recall, F1, and synthesizes pros/cons. Features reproducible runs, clean artifacts (plots/tables), and checklist-driven QA.",

        "title": "Autonomous Personal Tax Assistant",
        "description": "Upload salary slips, receipts, and statements; the agent extracts, validates, and drafts a tax estimate with references. Solves the challenge of mapping heterogeneous documents to tax rules with temporary embeddings, rule retrieval, schema validation, and draft form population. Features traceable calculations with citations and red-flag checks on missing/ambiguous fields.",
